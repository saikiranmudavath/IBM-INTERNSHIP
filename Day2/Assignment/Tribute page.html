        <strong>1940 - </strong>World War II is generally considered to have
        begun on 1 September 1939, when Nazi Germany, under Adolf Hitler,
        invaded Poland. The United Kingdom and France subsequently declared war
        on Germany on 3 September.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>1942 - </strong>World War II or the Second World War, often
        abbreviated as WWII or WW2, was a global war that lasted from 1939 to
        1945. It involved the vast majority of the world's countries—including
        all of the great powers—forming two opposing military alliances: the
        Allies and the Axis powers.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>1943 - </strong>In a total war directly involving more than 100
        million personnel from more than 30 countries, the major participants
        threw their entire economic, industrial, and scientific capabilities
        behind the war effort, blurring the distinction between civilian and
        military resources.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>1945 - </strong>Aircraft played a major role in the conflict,
        enabling the strategic bombing of population centres and the only two
        uses of nuclear weapons in war. World War II was by far the deadliest
        conflict in human history; it resulted in 70 to 85 million fatalities, a
        majority being civilians.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>1946 - </strong> Tens of millions of people died due to
        genocides (including the Holocaust), starvation, massacres, and disease.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>1949 - </strong> In the wake of the Axis defeat, Germany and
        Japan were occupied, and war crimes tribunals were conducted against
        German and Japanese leaders.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>1951 - </strong> From late 1939 to early 1941, in a series of
        campaigns and treaties, Germany conquered or controlled much of
        continental Europe, and formed the Axis alliance with Italy and Japan
        (along with other countries later on).
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>1953 - </strong>Under the Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact of August
        1939, Germany and the Soviet Union had partitioned Poland and marked out
        their "spheres of influence" across Finland, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania
        and Romania.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>1956 - </strong>Following the onset of campaigns in North Africa
        and East Africa, and the fall of France in mid-1940, the war continued
        primarily between the European Axis powers and the British Empire, with
        war in the Balkans, the aerial Battle of Britain, the Blitz of the UK,
        and the Battle of the Atlantic.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>1959 - </strong>On 22 June 1941, Germany led the European Axis
        powers in an invasion of the Soviet Union, opening the Eastern Front,
        the largest land theatre of war in history.
      </li>
      <p>
        Japan, which aimed to dominate Asia and the Pacific, was at war with the
        Republic of China by 1937. In December 1941, Japan attacked American and
        British territories with near-simultaneous offensives against Southeast
        Asia and the Central Pacific, including an attack on the US fleet at
        Pearl Harbor which resulted in the United States declaring war against
        Japan.
